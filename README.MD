# Assigment Week 8 - REST API

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Ireng Febrian Sanjaya. I'm entering week 8 and I practicing in making REST API of financial tracker this week and I do struggle alot in making this. I need alot of time to learn the logic, computational thinking and the connection on each part of the code. I try my best for this one.


## Tools

- JAVASCRIPT
- TYPESCRIPT
- CYCLIC

## Container

1. Code for Index.ts & Index.js

2. Code for App.ts & App.js

3. Package.Json

## Process

The process in the making of this project is just like last week, but the difference is that we didn't need any HTML, CSS or DOM. I just make exactly like last week in process but this time I'm only designing the app.ts and index.js (which is challenging) and compile it to Javascript.
